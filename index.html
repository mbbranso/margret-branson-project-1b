          <p> Hi, My name is Margaret Branson but for the purposes of this site, you can call me Mouse. I’m from Jackson, Mississippi and currently studying in New Orleans, Louisiana. After having a hard time figuring out what I wanted to study in college I realized that even in my most miserable moments, music helped me and I really began to understand its impact on my life in a grander sense. That’s when I decided to transfer to Loyola University New Orleans and study the music industry focusing on management and event production. By creating this site I’m trying to dedicate myself to exploring music in this new place and building my resume.  </p>
          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p> Currently Pursuing a Bachelors of Arts in Music Industry Studies at Loyola University, New Orleans. Projected to graduate in December 2023.</p>
          <h3>Experience</h3>
          <p>While my resume is lacking in directly Music Industry related skills I assure you that the experiences I've had and people I've met have given me useful people skills and perspective.</p>

            <h3> My Thoughts on The Rocky Horror Picture Show 3/3/2022</h3>
          <p>I have been quite the Rocky Horror fan for a few years now but only got to experience a midnight viewing with a shadow cast for the first time the other night. I have a group of friends back home who I would have LOVED to go see it with but they aren't here so I put my big girl fishnets on and went alone (with mace and one of those stabby cat keychains). It was a more welcoming experience that I could describe. I arrived in my makeshift 
            Frank N Furter costume and makeup feeling as fabulous as ever and hopped in line behind a group of people not mush older than me. When the actors came out of the theater to mark the virgins with red lipstick I eagerly identified myself as a Rocky Horror first timer and a red "V" was drawn on my cheeck. Upon seeing the marking and the fact that I was alone they insisted I sit with them and so I did. I would come to find out that one of them had seen the show 20 or more times and thus knew every. single. callout. I can't say much about what happened in the theater so as not to ruin it for the next virgin who somes along however I do think I came out of that theater feeling the most confident and exhilirated I've ever felt (at 3 am that is). I think everyone needs to see it with an active audience and shadow cast at least once. It's way more than a musical and its a great, safe, accepting place to be.</p>
